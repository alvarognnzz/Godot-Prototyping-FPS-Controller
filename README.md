## Godot 4 First Person Controller meant for prototyping
This controller acts as a foundation for testing and prototype projects. It includes a small code-based state machine. It should not be used for large projects as it may not be scalable.

## Features
As a testing controller, it only includes walking and sprinting functionality. More states can be added by modifying the state machine. The controller also includes a dynamic crosshair that reacts to objects in the Collsion Layer 2 using raycasts.

## Download
If you are starting a project from scratch, you can clone the repository and use the demo stage. If you already have a project and just want to download the controller, you can download it from [releases](https://github.com/netlaunch/Prototyping-FPS-Controller/releases).
